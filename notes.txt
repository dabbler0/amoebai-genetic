TIED
1. Inchworm. Inchworm is the evolution of Millipede.
1. Plant. Plant was an artificially-created gene made to split as much as possible. As a result it doesn't claim much territory, but it keeps its territory ery well.
2. Millipede. Millipede is so named because of the cells' tendency to form rows spaced apart by one (like '0 0 0 0 0') that crawl forward all together. Why this is advantageous I do not know, probably because it allows cells to pack together closely, and move together, without bumping into each other.
3. Quick-Iter. I don't actually know what this strategy is other than just "Chaos". It's called quick-iter because it was made by cycling very fast.
4. Walls-Down-Offspring. The genetic offspring of the Walls and Down strategy.
5. Passive. Passive doesn't grow much except when attacked; when it is attacked it grows very fast and moves away. this makes it very good at survival, but not very good at winning.
6. Walls. Also a chaotic strategy like Quick-Iter, but weaker.
7. Diagonal-Strands. The weakest growing strategy in existence. Makes diagonal strands and ships them across the board.
